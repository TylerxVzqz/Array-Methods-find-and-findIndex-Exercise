Hello, future software developer! In this exercise, you will practice using the array methods **`find`** and **`findIndex`**. ðŸ¥³

You are an explorer in a fantasy realm filled with mythical creatures. Your task is to catalog these creatures based on sightings. Each creature sighting is recorded in a catalog (an array of objects), where each entry includes the creature's name, type, and the last seen location.

Tasks:

- Use the **`find`** method to locate the first creature of the "Water" type and log its name to the console.
- Use the **`findIndex`** method to locate the index of the "Griffin" in the mythical creatures array and log it to the console.
- Use the **`find`** method to locate the first creature last seen in "Enchanted Forest".
